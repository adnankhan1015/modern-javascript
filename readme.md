# Modern JavaScript

## What is JavaScript?

- JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the web, alongside HTML & CSS.
- It is high-level, `interpreted programming language` that can be used on the client side as well as the server-side with Node.js
- Interpreted means that its executed line by line rather than being compiled into machine code first.
- So the code is **executed on the fly**, making it a **scripting language**, hence the name **JavaScript**.

## What is JavaScript used for?

- **DOM** (Document Object Model) Manipulation.
- **Event Handling** User actions are called events.
- **Asynchronous Request** is one of the most powerful uses of JavaScript, and its used to interact with backend servers whether its your own server that you created or a public API such as the GitHub or YouTube API.
  - So we can make HTTP requests right from our code to fetch data or submit data, and this happens all behind the scenes without having to refresh the page,
  - and this if often used in what are called **Single Page Applications (SPA)** to dynamically load and update content without having to reload the entire page.
- **Animations & Effects** There's many different ways that we can create these using JavaScript, we can use CSS transitions and animations with JavaScript.
- **Data Manipulataion** (Sorting, filtering, etc). Which is the process of modifying or transforming data, can be done with JavaScript because it's a full featured language with data structures like arrays, and this allows us to sort, filter and aggregate data.
- **Storing Data** (Cookies, LocalStorage, etc). JavaScript can also be used to store data on the client or in the browser using things like localStorage, SessionStorage, Cookies.
- **Single Page Applications (SPA)** These are applications that load a single HTML page and dynamically update the content without having to reload the entire page. Usually you would use a front-end framework for building SPAs. such as **ReactJS**, **VueJS** or **Angular** but you can also create them with Vanilla JavaScript

All the above steps are related to the front-end.

## Why Learn JavaScript?

- Popularity
- Versatility
- Relatively Easy to Learn
- Community

- You can also use it on the **sever side** with **Node JS** runtime, as well as **Deno**.
- So in addition to consuming APIs from the front-end, we can also create APIs that interact with databases on the backend.
- So it's used on both on the **front-end** and **back-end** of **Web development**, making it a **full stack** language

**Mobile Applications**

- There's technologies like **React Native** which allow you to build complex mobile applications.

**Desktop Applications**

- Technologies like **Electron** which allow you to create desktop applications. Some of the most popular desktop apps are actually built on JavaScript and **Electron**, including **VS Code an IDE**, as well as **Postman** which is HTTP client that we will be using.
